        I'm a rising Senior at the University of Oklahoma pursuing degrees in International Business and MIS.
        I'm hoping to use my current knowledge and skillset as well as gain valuable new experiences.

        I find great importance in gaining experiences through my involvement on campus.
        My acceptance in the Fall of 2021, into the JCPenney Leadership Program has resulted in my exceptional leadership and professional development.
        Through my time in the program, I have been able to foster important relationships and broaden my horizons.
        I have also been a part of the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority since my freshman year at OU. My passion for philanthropic efforts has been satisfied through the sororities partnership,
        and my efforts working with the Center for Children and Families Incorporated
